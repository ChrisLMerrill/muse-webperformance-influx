A project extension for the [Muse Test Framework](https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse) 
and [MuseIDE](http://ide4selenium.com). The extension currently contains just one plugin. 

# Send Measurements to Influx plugin

The plugin is a Measurements Consumer. When it receives measurements, it sends them to an InfluxDB server.

## Installation

The extension is distributed with the rest of the MuseIDE extensions - press the Extensions button in MuseIDE to add it to your project.  

## Configuration

The configuration of the plugin is described on [this blog post](https://www.webperformance.com/load-testing-tools/blog/2018/07/introducing-the-influx-extension-for-museide/).
